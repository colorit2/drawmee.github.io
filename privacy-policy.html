    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 22/05/2025</em></p>

    <p>Hi there 👋</p>

    <p>Thanks for using <strong>DrawMee</strong>!</p>

    <p>We’re <strong>Drawcial Studio</strong>, and we’re committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. We don’t collect more data than we need. We don’t sell your data. And we believe your data belongs to you.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what data we (Drawcial Studio) collect and what we do with it when you use our app <strong>DrawMee</strong>.</p>

    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <p>We aim to collect as little personal data as possible. In some cases, however, certain data may be collected to improve your experience or maintain the app's functionality.</p>
    <p>Here’s what we <em>may</em> collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Usage Data</strong> – such as how often you use the app, session duration, and which features you interact with.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Information</strong> – type of device, operating system version, language settings, and crash logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Drawings & Projects</strong> – any artwork you create within DrawMee stays on your device unless you choose to export or back it up.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional Account Info</strong> – if we ever offer accounts or cloud sync in the future, we may collect your email or username. Currently, DrawMee does not require login or registration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What we don’t collect</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your name</li>
      <li>Your email address (unless you contact us directly)</li>
      <li>Your IP address</li>
      <li>Your precise location</li>
      <li>Anything you draw, unless you choose to share it with us</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect data to:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Understand which features are useful and which ones need love 💜</li>
      <li>Fix bugs and crashes quickly 🐞</li>
      <li>Optionally respond to your feedback or questions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-party services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party tools to help us understand usage patterns and app performance (like analytics or crash reporting services). These tools may collect anonymized data to help us improve DrawMee.</p>
    <p>We only work with services that respect user privacy and comply with international privacy laws.</p>

    <h2>Your data, your choice</h2>
    <p>You’re in control:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can delete the app anytime — all locally stored data will be removed.</li>
      <li>If we ever introduce account features, you'll be able to delete your account and associated data.</li>
      <li>You can always reach out to us if you have questions or want your data deleted.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>DrawMee is safe for all ages, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you're a parent and believe your child has shared personal info with us, please contact us and we’ll delete it.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy if DrawMee changes or if laws require it. If it’s a big update, we’ll let you know via the app or website. Small updates will just show up here.</p>
